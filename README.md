# Bazel React

## Introduction

An example of a React + typescript application built on Vite with Bazel.

To build and run the application, simply type:

```bash
bazel run //frontend-react:preview
```

## Configuration files

`//pnpm-workspace.yaml`

This file lists all projects in the monorepo which are based on pnpm.

`//package.json`

The root package.json defines global settings, shared dependencies, and tooling configurations that apply to the entire monorepo.

`//frontend-react/package.json`

Each project has its own package.json to declare its specific dependencies, scripts, and configurations. This keeps the project self-contained and decoupled from other projects in the monorepo.

If you want to run and debug your react application without Bazel, the project needs its own package.json with all necessary dependencies.

`//:pnpm-lock.yaml`

This file is generated by pnpm and contains a list of all the packages and their versions used in the monorepo. It is used by pnpm to manage the dependencies and it is generated reading the all the package.json files in the monorepo.

`//MODULE.bazel`

This files must contains the dependencies rules_nodejs and aspect_rules_js.
